## Contributing
Kevein
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
